			 		<p class=" text-center text-justify">
			 			The Final Fantasy video game series has been both critically and commercially successful, selling more than 144 million games worldwide, making it one of the best-selling video game franchises of all time. The series is well known for its innovation, visuals, and music, such as the inclusion of full-motion videos (FMVs), photorealistic character models, and music by Nobuo Uematsu. It has been a driving force in the video game industry, and the series has affected Square Enix's business practices and its relationships with other video game developers. It has popularized many features now common in role-playing games, also popularizing the genre as a whole in markets outside Japan.

			 		<h2>Final Fantasy</h2>
			 		<p class="text-justify">
			 			Final Fantasy, also known as Final Fantasy I in re-releases, is a role-playing game developed and published by Square Co., Ltd. for the Nintendo Entertainment System in Japan in December 1987, and the first title in Square's flagship Final Fantasy series. The game was later released in North America in 1990, and has since been re-released worldwide on the PlayStation, the Game Boy Advance, the PlayStation Portable, iOS, Android, and many other platforms, with re-releases making modifications and adding new content. The game was directed by Hironobu Sakaguchi, with Nobuo Uematsu composing the score (as his sixteenth work of video game music composition). 
			 		</p>
			 		<p class="text-justify">
			 			The game puts players in control of four characters known as the Warriors of Light, and begins by asking the player to select the classes and names of each. The Warriors of Light can traverse the maps of dungeons and towns, which are connected by a world map, and will run into random encounters with enemies or fight bosses. Battles are controlled using menus in a turn-based fashion, in which characters can use attacks and Magic, depending on the class they have equipped. 
			 		</p>
			 		<p class="text-justify">
			 			Final Fantasy takes place in a fantasy medieval setting with three major continents, and the four Warriors of Light begin in Cornelia. They are tasked by the King of Cornelia to rescue Princess Sarah from Garland, and after defeating him, the king opens up a bridge enabling them to pass to the town of Pravoka. This sets them off on an adventure to defeat the Four Fiends and rescue the world

	 			<h2>Final Fantasy II</h2>
		 		<p class="text-justify">
		 			Final Fantasy II is the second installment in the Final Fantasy series, developed and published by Squaresoft. It was released in December 1988 for the Family Computer exclusively in Japan, but was later re-released worldwide for the PlayStation, the Game Boy Advance, the PlayStation Portable, iOS, Android, and other platforms. It was directed by Hironobu Sakaguchi, with Yoshitaka Amano designing the characters and Nobuo Uematsu composing the score. It was notable for being one of the first story-intensive RPGs released for console systems, and introducing many series staples, including chocobos and a character named Cid. Its story is unrelated to the original Final Fantasy, and its gameplay is a major departure from the previous title for eliminating the traditional experience-based progression system.
		 		</p>
		 		<p class="text-justify">
		 			The game centers on a conflict by the Palamecian Empire, whose Emperor Mateus is using hellspawn to try to conquer the world. The protagonist, Firion, along with his allies Maria and Guy, join the Wild Rose Rebellion to fight them, and meet many allies along the way to try to stop the Emperor and save the world. 
		 		</p>
		 		<p class="text-justify">
		 			Final Fantasy II eliminates the leveling system from the previous game, focusing on the playable characters' stats, which increase according to how much they are used or required; for example, a character who frequently casts Magic would have their magic proficiency increase faster, while a character who frequently takes damage would have their maximum HP increase. Battles are fought in the turn-based system seen in the previous game, though each character has their class and abilities defined.

		 			<h2>Final Fantasy III</h2>
			 		<p class="text-justify">
			 			Final Fantasy III is the third installment in the Final Fantasy series, developed and published by Squaresoft. It was released in April 1990 for the Family Computer exclusively in Japan. It was later remade in 3D by Matrix Software and released worldwide for the Nintendo DS, with this version re-released for iOS, Android, the PlayStation Portable, Microsoft Windows, and other platforms. It was directed by Hironobu Sakaguchi, with Nobuo Uematsu composing the score and Yoshitaka Amano providing the image design. The original version was not released outside of Japan, introduced the earliest form of the job system, which has since become something of a Final Fantasy staple. 
			 		</p>
			 		<p class="text-justify">
			 			The story revolves around four Warriors of Light who begin as Onion Knights in the original release, although they are named Luneth, Arc, Refia and Ingus in the 3D remake. When they find the Wind Crystal, it grants them its power, and instructs them to restore balance to the world. 
			 		</p>
			 		<p class="text-justify">
			 			Final Fantasy III introduces the job system, in which the four characters can equip one of twenty-three jobs, earned by finding crystals or completing sidequests. Jobs grant the player characters abilities, such as Magic, and some special commands associated with specific jobs, such as Steal associated with the Thief and Jump associated with the Dragoon. Using a job for longer increases the characters' stats.

		 		<h2>Final Fantasy IV</h2>
		 			<p class="text-justify">
		 			Final Fantasy IV is the fourth main installment in the Final Fantasy series, developed and published by Squaresoft. It was released in July 1991 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in Japan, and released as Final Fantasy II in North America in October 1991 (with alterations made due to Nintendo of America's guidelines at the time). It has subsequently been re-released worldwide as Final Fantasy IV for the PlayStation, Game Boy Advance and other platforms, as well as a re-release on PlayStation Portable as part of a collection with its two sequels. A three-dimensional remake, developed by Matrix Software and published by Square Enix, was released for the Nintendo DS, iOS, Android and Steam platforms. The game was directed by Hironobu Sakaguchi, with Yoshitaka Amano providing the character designs and Nobuo Uematsu composing the score. It was the first title developed for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, the second overall released in North America, and the first to introduce the series' iconic Active Time Battle system.
		 			</p>
		 			<p class="text-justify">
		 			The game takes place in a medieval fantasy setting, and focuses on Cecil Harvey, the captain of the Red Wings of Baron. After performing a raid on Mysidia to steal the Water Crystal, Cecil and the knights question the orders of their king as they believed stealing from the Mysidians was wrong. As punishment for disloyalty, the king strips Cecil of his title, and orders him and Kain Highwind to win back his trust by sending him to the village of Mist. This sets Cecil off on an adventure in which he and many other allies he meets must uncover the truth and save the world from monsters. 
		 			</p>
		 			<p class="text-justify">
		 			Final Fantasy IV is the first game to use the Active Time Battle system, in which characters' moves are represented by a gauge and they can perform an action when the gauge is full. A party consists of up to five characters, each with two unique abilities. Characters unlock new abilities and improve their stats as they level up. In the 3D versions, additional customization is available in the form of Augments, that allow characters to use different abilities.

		 			<p class="text-justify">
		 			Final Fantasy V is the fifth main installment in the Final Fantasy series, developed and published by Squaresoft. It was released for the Super Famicom in Japan in 1992, and has since been re-released in Japan and in the west on PlayStation in 1998, on Game Boy Advance in 2006, on iOS and Android in 2013, and on Microsoft Windows via Steam in 2015. It was directed by Hironobu Sakaguchi, with Yoshitaka Amano providing the character design and Nobuo Uematsu composing the score. It was the only installment on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System that was not released outside of Japan, with Final Fantasy IV and Final Fantasy VI both releasing in North America titled Final Fantasy II and Final Fantasy III, respectively. It was the first Final Fantasy to use kanji in text as well as hiragana and katakana. 
		 		</p>
		 		<p class="text-justify">
		 			The game takes place in a medieval fantasy setting, and centers on a group of four strangers brought together by circumstance to save the Crystals that have mysteriously begun shattering. The one behind the phenomenon is the antagonist Exdeath, as part of a plan to release himself from imprisonment and gain the power of the Void, a realm of nothingness, which could bestow absolute power on one able to resist being absorbed by it. The four become the Warriors of Light and turn their attentions to defeating Exdeath and stopping the Void's energies from consuming their world. 
		 		</p>
		 		<p class="text-justify">
		 			The key feature of Final Fantasy V is the job system, which allows each of the four characters to switch to one of twenty-two jobs, and master the jobs to retain their abilities and stats when using a different job. The four can use the abilities of their current job and any mastered abilities they have equipped from other jobs. Battles are fought using the Active Time Battle system. Much of the strategy revolves around mixing up combinations of jobs, or learning the right skills from a job to use in combination with skills from another job, to defeat challenging dungeons and bosses.

		 			<p class="text-justify">
		 			Final Fantasy VI is the sixth main installment in the Final Fantasy series, developed and published by Squaresoft. It was released in April 1994 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in Japan, and released as Final Fantasy III in North America in October 1994 (with alterations made due to Nintendo of America's guidelines at the time). Later, it was re-released worldwide as Final Fantasy VI for the PlayStation, Game Boy Advance, iOS, Android, and Microsoft Windows platforms, with re-releases making changes including modified graphics and additional content. It was co-directed by Yoshinori Kitase and Hiroyuki Itou, taking over from Hironobu Sakaguchi, with Nobuo Uematsu composing the score and Yoshitaka Amano providing image design. It was the final title in the series to feature two-dimensional graphics, and the first story that did not revolve around crystals.  
		 		</p>
		 		<p class="text-justify">
		 			Final Fantasy VI focuses on a conflict between the Gestahlian Empire conquering the world and a rebel faction opposed to them known as the Returners, taking place in a fantasy steampunk-style world. The Empire has acquired great power by experimenting on captured espers, magical creatures of legend. The Returners seek magical power to fight the Empire on equal terms, and an amnesiac former imperial soldier, Terra Branford, proves key to both sides for understanding magic and espers.
		 		</p>
		 		<p class="text-justify">
		 			The game gives players up to fourteen playable characters, the largest cast in the series, and features the Active Time Battle pseudo-turn based menu command system. A party can consist of up to four characters, though some events require the player to assemble three different parties of up to four and switch between them. Each character has a unique command ability, such as Terra's Trance, Locke's Steal, Edgar's Tools or Sabin's Blitz, and can also learn Magic spells from earning AP from battles with magicite equipped. Each character's rare Desperation Attack will randomly activate after using the Attack command when at critical health.

		 		<h2>Final Fantasy VII</h2>
		 			<p class="text-justify">
		 			Final Fantasy VII is the seventh main installment in the Final Fantasy series, developed and published by Squaresoft. It was released in January 1997 for the PlayStation, and was later re-released for the Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, PlayStation Vita, PlayStation 4, iOS, Android, Xbox One and Switch platforms, it is also included on the PlayStation Classic mini console. It was directed by Yoshinori Kitase, produced by Hironobu Sakaguchi, with a score produced by Nobuo Uematsu and character designs by Tetsuya Nomura. It was the first title in the series to feature three-dimensional graphics, pre-rendered backgrounds and numerous full motion videos, and the first to be released in Europe. 
		 		</p>
		 		<p class="text-justify">
		 			Final Fantasy VII follows the story of mercenary Cloud Strife, who is hired by the eco-terrorist group AVALANCHE—led by Barret Wallace—to help fight the mega-corporation Shinra Electric Power Company, who attempts to drain the planet's lifeblood as an energy source to further their profits. Apathetic to the cause, Cloud initially fights for personal gain, and for the promise he made to childhood friend Tifa Lockhart. Cloud eventually joins forces with many others to save the planet, which is threatened by Shinra and Cloud's nemesis Sephiroth, and discovers a reason to fight for a cause other than his own. 
		 		</p>
		 		<p class="text-justify">
		 			The gameplay is a departure from previous entries in the series in many ways. Though it retains the Active Time Battle pseudo-turn based menu command system, Final Fantasy VII features three party members rather than four. The Materia system allows the player to customize each party member's abilities to their liking, and the Limit system grants them unique combat skills. Though minigames had been a recurring feature, Final Fantasy VII introduces numerous new ones, many of them playable in the theme park Gold Saucer varying from racing with Chocobos to snowboarding.

		 		<h2>Final Fantasy VIII</h2>
		 			<p class="text-justify">
		 			Final Fantasy VIII is the eighth main installment in the Final Fantasy series, developed and published by Squaresoft. It was released in February 1999 for the PlayStation, and has since been re-released on Microsoft Windows in 2000, with this version being ported to Steam in 2013. A remastered version will be released in 2019 on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC via Steam 
		 		</p>
		 		<p class="text-justify">
		 			Final Fantasy VIII was directed by Yoshinori Kitase, with Tetsuya Nomura providing the character design and Nobuo Uematsu composing the score. It is the first game in the series to consistently use realistically proportioned characters, and the first to feature a vocal piece as its theme music in the form of "Eyes on Me". 
		 		</p>
		 		<p class="text-justify">
		 			Final Fantasy VIII is set on a fantasy world with science fiction elements, and focuses on Squall Leonhart, a young SeeD mercenary hired out to various missions by Balamb Garden. Squall and his friends are enlisted to help a group known as the Forest Owls led by Rinoa Heartilly, an endeavor that escalates into a conflict against the forces led by Sorceress Edea.
		 		</p>
		 		<p class="text-justify">
		 			The gameplay makes a departure from many series standards. While it still uses the Active Time Battle system, it deviates from the series' traditional means of boosting a character's power via leveling (although levels are not completely abandoned as they were in Final Fantasy II). In addition, it does not have a Magic Point-based system for spell-casting. Instead, magic is collected, drawn, and created from items, and is used to power up the characters via the junction system.

		 		<h2>Final Fantasy IX</h2>
		 			<p class="text-justify">
		 			Final Fantasy IX is the ninth main installment in the Final Fantasy series, developed and published by Squaresoft. It was released in July 2000 for the PlayStation, later re-released in 2016 for iOS, Android and Microsoft Windows via Steam; re-released in 2017 for PlayStation 4; and repackaged in 2019 for Windows 10, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. It was directed by Hiroyuki Ito and co-produced by Hironobu Sakaguchi and Shinji Hashimoto, with Nobuo Uematsu providing the musical score. The title is a return to the series's roots, with gameplay features and references to the past games featuring throughout, as well as a medieval fantasy setting and cartoonish art style as a break from the sci-fi slant style of Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII. 
		 		</p>
		 		<p class="text-justify">
		 			Taking place on planet Gaia, the story follows a thief named Zidane Tribal, a member of a thief troupe who is tasked to kidnap the princess of Alexandria, Garnet Til Alexandros XVII. He teams up with her and a team of allies to stop Queen Brahne and her ally Kuja from waging a war with an army of black mages. 
		 		</p>
		 		<p class="text-justify">
		 			The gameplay features the Active Time Battle pseudo-turn based menu command system from previous games, and gives players control of up to eight characters in a party of four. Each character has access to two command abilities, of which at least one is a skillset that grants them access to a larger range of abilities. Abilities are unlocked by equipping certain weapons, armor and add-ons that grant abilities as AP is earned. Each character can use a unique Trance after taking damage that enhances their abilities. Aside from combat, the game features several different minigames and sidequests, with the most notable being Chocobo Hot and Cold, and the Tetra Master card game.

		 		<h2>Final Fantasy X</h2>
		 			<p class="text-justify">
		 			Final Fantasy X is the tenth main installment in the Final Fantasy series, developed and published by Squaresoft. It was released in July 2001 for the PlayStation 2 and has since been re-released as part of the Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita in 2013, for PlayStation 4 in 2015, and for Microsoft Windows in 2016. It was directed by Yoshinori Kitase, with Tetsuya Nomura providing the character design and Nobuo Uematsu and Masashi Hamauzu composing the score. It was the first title in the series released on sixth-generation consoles, the first to feature fully three-dimensional areas rather than including pre-rendered backdrops, and the first to include voice acting. 
		 		</p>
		 		<p class="text-justify">
		 			The game is set in the world of Spira and follows the story of Tidus and Yuna. Tidus is a star athlete blitzball player, who is taken to Spira by Auron after a monster called Sin destroys his home city of Zanarkand. Tidus then joins the summoner, Yuna on her pilgrimage with her guardians to defeat Sin and bring about the Calm. 
		 		</p>
		 		<p class="text-justify">
		 			The gameplay makes use of the Conditional Turn-Based Battle system rather than the typical Active Time Battle, in which characters' stats and other factors determine when they get a turn. Parties consist of three members, though it is possible to swap out a character for another party member at any time. Characters can unlock abilities using the Sphere Grid, which sets character down a specific path with stats and abilities, but eventually opens up, allowing characters to unlock all abilities (aside from Yuna's summon). Each character also has a unique set of abilities known as their Overdrive. Locations are mostly linear and are not connected by a world map, though players can revisit locations at any point once the airship is obtained.

		 		<h2>Final Fantasy XI</h2>
		 			<p class="text-justify">
		 			Final Fantasy XI, also known as Final Fantasy XI Online, is the franchise's first MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game), as well as the eleventh installment in the main series. Final Fantasy XI was the world's first cross-console MMORPG, available for Windows, PlayStation 2, Xbox 360 and Steam. Since its release in 2002, it has become the most financially successful title in the Final Fantasy series. 
		 		</p>
		 		<p class="text-justify">
		 			Due to the nature of online RPGs, Final Fantasy XI differs in that the player is not the only hero. Instead, each player creates a customizable character and adventures through the world of Vana'diel with other players; leveling up, exploring, completing missions, quests, and much more. Leveling up requires a group of people working together in what is called a Party, with each participant contributing their own skills to help take down a foe and gain Experience points. Battles occur in real-time, taking the ATB system to a new level, which was emulated again to a certain extent in Final Fantasy XII. 
		 		</p>
		 		<p class="text-justify">
		 			At the game's peak, there were some five hundred thousand people playing Final Fantasy XI, utilizing over two million characters. With constant updates and Expansions added, Vana'diel is not a static world; instead, it changes and evolves with the passage of time.  
		 		</p>
		 		<p class="text-justify">
		 			On April 3rd, 2015, the development team announced the conclusion to expansions, add-ons, and other major additions after November 2015. Service for the PS2 and Xbox 360 versions ended on March 31, 2016, and the game can now only be played on the PC version.

		 		<h2>Final Fantasy XII</h2>
		 			<p class="text-justify">
		 			Final Fantasy XII is the twelfth main installment in the Final Fantasy series, developed and published by Square Enix, and the fourth game set in the world of Ivalice. It was released in March 2006 for the PlayStation 2, and was later re-released in Japan as an international version titled Final Fantasy XII International Zodiac Job System, with heavy changes made to the character development system by introducing jobs. This version was re-released worldwide for PlayStation 4 in July 2017, and for Steam in February 2018, as an HD remaster containing new updates, titled Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age. Final Fantasy XII was directed by Hiroyuki Ito, who also designed the battle system and supervised The Zodiac Age, with Akihiko Yoshida designing the main characters and Hitoshi Sakimoto producing the musical score. Later, on April 30th, 2019 it was released for Nintendo Switch with minor updates. 
		 		</p>
		 		<p class="text-justify">
		 			The game is set in the continent of Ivalice, in which the Archadian and Rozarrian Empires wage an endless war for power, and Dalmasca has been caught between the two and annexed by Archadia. Dalmasca's princess, Ashelia B'nargin Dalmasca, has created a resistance movement against Archadia to avenge her fallen kingdom, and along the way is united with a band of allies to seek a power capable of defeating the Archadian Empire. 
		 		</p>
		 		<p class="text-justify">
		 			Final Fantasy XII features vastly different gameplay from previous entries, with the most notable differences being the elimination of random encounters in favor of engaging enemies on the field with no separate battle screen using the Active Dimension Battle system. Characters are controlled with menu commands, or programmed using a gambit system. By purchasing licenses on a License Board with LP, characters can unlock the ability to equip new weapons, armor and accessories, as well as to make use of abilities such as White Magicks, Black Magicks, Time Magicks, Green Magicks, Arcane Magicks and Technicks. In the original, each character uses the same License Board, but in the Zodiac releases, different License Boards are used for different jobs, with characters each assigned a job. Locations are connected by an open world rather than a world map, with many side quests available to the player, such as Hunts.

		 		<h2>Final Fantasy XIII</h2>
		 			<p class="text-justify">
		 			Final Fantasy XIII is the thirteenth main installment in the Final Fantasy series and the flagship title of the Fabula Nova Crystallis: Final Fantasy sub-series, developed and published by Square Enix. It was released in December 2009 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and has since been re-released on Microsoft Windows in 2014. It was directed by Motomu Toriyama, with Tetsuya Nomura designing the main characters and Masashi Hamauzu composing the score. The game runs on the Crystal Tools engine. It was the first multiplatform Final Fantasy title, and the first to be translated into traditional Chinese.  
		 		</p>
		 		<p class="text-justify">
		 			Final Fantasy XIII is set on the world of Gran Pulse, above which floats Cocoon, an artificial biodome on which humanity lives, fearful of the surface world. Lightning, a member of the Guardian Corps military forces, goes rogue when her sister Serah is branded a l'Cie by a fal'Cie from Gran Pulse, designating her an enemy of Cocoon. The Sanctum government authorizes a Purge of citizens who may have come in contact with the fal'Cie, and Lightning meets up with the pilot Sazh Katzroy on her way to find Serah amid the Purge. Also caught up in the Purge are Snow Villiers, Serah's fiance and leader of the anti-authority group NORA, and the civilians Hope Estheim and Oerba Dia Vanille. The five come into contact with the Pulse fal'Cie, Anima, and are branded l'Cie, seemingly with the Focus to destroy Cocoon.
		 		</p>
		 		<p class="text-justify">
		 			The gameplay makes use of the Command Synergy Battle system, a more fast-paced menu based combat system that derives from the Active Time Battle system. The player controls the party leader, and chains as many actions as there are ATB gauges, with different actions consuming different amounts of ATB. The party's abilities and actions are determined by the current paradigm, with combat requiring the player to shift between paradigms and to level the paradigm roles via the Crystarium system. The first half of the game is linear, while the latter half opens up once the party reaches Gran Pulse.

		 		<h2>Final Fantasy XIV</h2>
		 			<p class="text-justify">
		 			Final Fantasy XIV Online, also known collectively with its initial relaunched title Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn, is the relaunched version of the fourteenth installment of the Final Fantasy series and the second, after Final Fantasy XI, to be an MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game). 
		 		</p>
		 		<p class="text-justify">
		 			The original version of Final Fantasy XIV received heavy criticism at launch in 2010, prompting an official apology and the replacement of its development team. In October, 2011 Square Enix announced the game would be relaunched as Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn, an entirely new version rebuilt from the ground up. A Realm Reborn would carry over the original game's setting, lore and story, but feature a new client, server structure, graphics engine, interface, terrain, and content.  
		 		</p>
		 		<p class="text-justify">
		 			The original version of the game, termed Version 1.0 or Legacy, received its final update in November 2012 and its service concluded that December. Alpha testing for A Realm Reborn commenced in November 2012, with beta testing following throughout the first half of 2013. The game officially relaunched on Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 3 platforms on August 27th, 2013, and then officially launched on the PlayStation 4 on April 14th, 2014. Support for the PlayStation 3 version ended in June 2017. Support for 32-bit Windows ended in July 2019.

		 		<h2>Final Fantasy XV</h2>
		 			<p class="text-justify">
		 			Final Fantasy XV is the fifteenth main installment in the main Final Fantasy series. The game was released worldwide on November 29, 2016 for the PlayStation 4 (supporting PlayStation 4 Pro, but optimized for the standard version) and Xbox One, and later March 6, 2018 on PC as the Windows Edition. It was directed by Hajime Tabata, but began development under Tetsuya Nomura, who provided character designs for the main cast, with the soundtrack composed by Yoko Shimomura. Final Fantasy XV is the first action role-playing game in the main series, and the first single-player Final Fantasy game to be released with the "games as a service" model, receiving numerous free updates as well as paid DLC and seasonal events.  
		 		</p>
		 		<p class="text-justify">
		 			The story is told over the course of 15 chapters. It focuses on Noctis Lucis Caelum, a prince from the kingdom of Lucis who fights to reclaim his throne and must go on to fulfill a greater destiny. Final Fantasy XV aims to examine its characters' humanity and place them in a more realistic setting than most Final Fantasy games. Its prominent themes are friendship, destiny, and legacy. 
		 		</p>
		 		<p class="text-justify">
		 			The gameplay features an open world environment and makes use of the Active X Battle system, a real time battle system. The first half of Final Fantasy XV is open world, traversable with the Regalia and chocobos, and enables players to take on a variety of quests, explore, and play minigames. Objectives later become more specific, in accordance with other Final Fantasy titles. In the original release, only Noctis was playable, though patches have allowed players to switch between controlling any of the four main characters while in battle in the open world.
